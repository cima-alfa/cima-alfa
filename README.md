### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeremy, I am 25 years old and I have been interested in web dev since I was about 12.
Since then, I've done a few projects for clients in Germany and the Czech Republic.

### Universae DAW

I am currently studying web app development at the UNIVERSAE Higher Vocational Training Institute in Spain, Madrid.
Even though I have quite a bit of experience, I still have a lot to learn and getting a diploma should hopefully help with better job opportunities.
